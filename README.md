# 🔤 Neural Transliteration: English ➡️ Bengali
> 🛠️ Python | TensorFlow | LSTM | FastText

## 🧠 Overview

This project presents a **neural machine transliteration** system designed to convert **English words into Bengali script** using a sequence-to-sequence LSTM architecture. The model is trained to handle phonetic transliteration tasks that bridge the gap between Romanized and native Bengali representations.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔁 **LSTM Encoder-Decoder** model for sequence-to-sequence transliteration  
- ⚡ **FastText embeddings** integrated for contextual understanding of characters  
- 🧹 Robust **tokenization and feature engineering** for cleaner input-output sequences  
- 📈 Achieved a **BLEU-4 score of 20.98**, validating transliteration accuracy  
- 🌍 Supports **cross-lingual and cross-cultural communication**
